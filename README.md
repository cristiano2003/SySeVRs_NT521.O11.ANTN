# ReSyVRs

## Overview
This project involves a series of steps to generate slices (SeVCs) from source code, preprocess data, and utilize a deep learning model for analysis. In this i've able to run SySeVRs. 
## Instructions for Running Scripts
Please read and install what you need in **config.sh** instead of running them.

## Step 1: Generating Slices (SeVCs)
if you have problem while running get_cfg_relationg.py make sure you've install the right python-igraph version i've mentioned in the config.sh instead of igraph. This is wrong library.
## Step 2: Data Preprocessing

## Step 3: Deep Learning Model
